joaquin lay still on his bed, looking out through the window. it was still dark outside. it had been three days since he had last slept for more than an hour at a stretch, even moving had become incresingly difficult in the past three days, so the only thing he could do was read books, the only thing that gave his life any meaning.

he had alwayd been a sick child since the day he was born. his childhood had been spent having seizures and blackouts.

The 41st residence on long street was on the far end, towards the coast in the aristocrat's district in the capital of the dragon-phoenix colony of the hedor empire. it was the an oddity among the vast estates of the nobility which resided in the district, for a lone courtyard stood in the estate which was possibly the largest in the entire district. 

 a boy lay on the bed, looking out through the window, his eyes held a strange calm, a still look, reminiscing, odd for one so young, an adult barely, as a matter of fact he had just turned 16, legally an afdult, a few hours ago. yet the look on his face was mature beyond his years, so much so that had it been on an old man on his deathbed, ikt would have been more fitting.the only differentiating factor from an old man was the hint of confusion on his brows and that the strange calm was the carefreeness of youth who had not yet experienced the pleasures of life rather than gratitude for a life well lived. he continued observing the horizon through his window, as the night sky slowly turned from dark blue to a lighter hue, and lighter still, until the sun was barely visible over the horizon, and the sky turned a dim yellow-orange.
 
 the young man turned his head slowly as the faint sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway leading to his bedroom, the footsteps grew louder and someone knocked on the door. 
 
 'young master, may i come in?' the sweet voice of a young girl came from the other side of the door.
 
 'you can come in, angelica' he said in a low, deep, yet an incredibly weak voice.
 
 Angelica entered the room. she made an effort to smile, yet it was clear at a glance that she was feeling more concerned than cheerful. She put the tray containing joaquin's medicine on the bedstand and put her palm over his forehead to check his temperature. It was very cold. 
 Noticing the frown on her face, joaquin curled his lips in a warm, although weak, smile.
 
 'im alright' joaquin tried to reassure her.
 
 'were you able to sleep well last night, young master?' she asked.

 Joaquin's smile turned down a notch, he had not had even an hour's stretch of sleep since the last few days. although he had alwayd been a sick child, his childhood spent amidst seizures and blackouts, his health had deteriorated alarmingly in the last three days, so far down in fact that he was not letting on even half of it, so as to not worry angelica.
 It was bad enough already, he thought, that *dash* had passed away yesterday night. *dash* was the butler of the estate who had looked after joaquin ever since he could remember, despite his status, he had always been more of a father figure to him than his biological father.
